# PyMineLauncher

- Minecraft launcher with full moded support and multiple instances.
- Currently curseforge modpacks are disabled due to stability issues.
- The current `pml.py` is a temporary command-line interface for the program.
- I'm planning on adding a GUI soon.

## Build

- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Then run `python main.py`
